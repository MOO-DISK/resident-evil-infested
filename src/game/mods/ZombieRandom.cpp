// ZombieRandom.cpp - port-added: the zombie mod's randomized scenario.
//
// Every game of the mode is a new mansion run (the return mansion, stages 6
// and 7 - zombie_mode_new_game). The survivors still win by RE1's own route:
// the four crests (Wind, Moon, Star, Sun) open room 0x1A's door to the
// storeroom, and the storeroom's back door to the courtyard is the win. What
// changes per game:
//   - which mansion key (sword / armor / shield / helmet) opens each
//     key-locked door;
//   - where those keys and the four crests lie;
//   - which weapon or ammo lies at each weapon / ammo spot.
// The puzzles are left out: every key and crest is a plain pickup, and the
// doors a puzzle or a one-way lock keeps shut start unlocked (all but the
// crest door).
//
// One seed (the host's, handed out in the lobby - ZombieNet.cpp) makes the
// whole scenario: every copy reads the same RDT files and runs the same
// generator, so they agree without sending the result.
//
// The data comes straight from the RDTs, at the start of each game:
//   doors   every door_set (SCD 0x0C) of the room's init and per-frame
//           scripts - lock byte +0x0C (0x80 locked, low 6 bits the lock
//           flag), destination +0x0D, the item it needs +0x16.
//   spots   every item_model_set (0x18) - item +10, quantity +11, the
//           roomItems flag +0x16 (which names the spot), room action slot +1.
// A spot can take a randomized item if its record is at the top level of the
// script (not inside an if block - those are story or puzzle states), no
// room_action_reset / room_action_arm (0x12 / 0x13) re-arms its slot (that is
// how a puzzle hands an item out), it is the only record under its flag, and
// it originally held a key, a crest, a weapon, ammo or a map.
//
// The keys and crests are placed by "assumed fill": in a random order, each
// goes to a random free room's spot reachable from the main hall while every item
// not yet placed is assumed to be in hand - which always leaves a route that
// collects everything. The leftover spots get the shuffled weapons and ammo.
// The route crosses only doors whose triggers are live in the mode
// (kDoorGates), counts a room only when the main hall can be reached back from
// it, and keeps progression out of rooms with unverified furniture
// (kUnverifiedRooms).
